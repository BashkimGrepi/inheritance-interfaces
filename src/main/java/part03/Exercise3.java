/**
 * This class demonstrates how to use the List interface in Java. The List
 * interface is a part of the Java standard library and it defines methods for
 * working with lists. Several classes, such as ArrayList and LinkedList,
 * implement the List interface, so they can be used as a List.
 *
 * It is often a good idea to use the List interface instead of the ArrayList or
 * LinkedList classes directly. This way your code can operate on any type of a
 * list, not just on ArrayLists or LinkedLists. This makes your code more
 * flexible and compatible with code written by other people.
 *
 * See https://stackoverflow.com/a/2575454 for discussion about the topic.

     * Bonus ðŸš€!
     *
     * This method returns a random element from the given list. However, this
     * method is even more flexible than the previous ones, as it can not only be
     * used with lists of Strings, but with lists of any type.
     *
     * In this example the method is generic, which means that it has a type
     * parameter. The type parameter is defined in the method signature and its name
     * is "T", but you can use any name you want. The type parameter is used in both
     * the parameter and return value, so Java knows that the return value is always
     * of the same type as the argument. This way you can call the method with lists
     * of Strings and Java knows it returns a String. Simlarly, with a list of
     * Integers, or any other type, Java knows the return value is of the same type.
     *
     * If you find this kind of stuff interesting, you can read more about generics
     * at dev.java: https://dev.java/learn/generics/intro/. If you rather spend your
     * time on something else, feel free to skip this method ðŸ˜‚.
